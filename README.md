#  Reverse Griding

A simple web-based project that demonstrates working with arrays, string manipulation, and DOM operations in **JavaScript**.  

The app allows users to input their name (or any text), and it displays the result across **three columns**:

1. **Original Input** → Shows the exact text entered by the user.  
2. **Reverse Column** → Displays the same text along with a **Reverse** button. Clicking the button reverses the text.  
3. **Correct Column** → Displays the reversed text along with a **Correct** button. Clicking the button re-reverses the text back to its original form.
